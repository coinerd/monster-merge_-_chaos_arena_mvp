# 🛠️ Proposed Architectural Improvements Checklist

## 1. Modularization & Separation of Concerns

- [ ] **Divide the code into modules:**
  - [ ] Game Engine/Loop module for timing, updating, and drawing cycles.
  - [ ] Scene Manager to handle transitions between game states.
  - [ ] Entity System for managing game objects (monsters, projectiles, etc.).
- [ ] **Create an Input Handling Module:**
  - [ ] Centralize event listeners for mouse, keyboard, and touch inputs.
  - [ ] Translate raw events into game commands.

---

## 2. Introduce an Entity-Component System (ECS)

- [ ] Implement an ECS architecture:
  - [ ] Create reusable components (e.g., position, velocity, renderable, collidable).
  - [ ] Define systems to update components (e.g., movement, collision, rendering).
- [ ] Migrate existing entities to the ECS pattern.

---

## 3. Improve State Management

- [ ] Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM):
  - [ ] Define states (e.g., “init,” “loading,” “active,” “paused,” “game over”).
  - [ ] Establish clear state transition rules.
- [ ] Separate UI (menus, HUD) from core game logic:
  - [ ] Create distinct modules or scenes for main menu, gameplay, and results screens.

---

## 4. Utilize Modern JavaScript/TypeScript Features

- [ ] Migrate to TypeScript for type safety and clearer interfaces.
- [ ] Modularize code using ES Modules:
  - [ ] Separate files for core systems (rendering, input, physics, etc.).
- [ ] Leverage ES6+ features (e.g., classes, async/await, destructuring).

---

## 5. Enhanced Rendering Pipeline

- [ ] Implement double-buffering or off-screen canvases:
  - [ ] Use off-screen canvases for static or infrequently updated elements.
- [ ] Organize rendering into layers:
  - [ ] Background layer.
  - [ ] Gameplay layer.
  - [ ] Foreground/UI layer.

---

## 6. Performance and Scalability

- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects:
  - [ ] Pool for particles and temporary game effects.
- [ ] Decouple update and render logic:
  - [ ] Maintain separate update and render loops.
- [ ] Optimize collision detection and pathfinding algorithms.

---

## 7. Testing & Debugging Aids

- [ ] Implement a debug mode:
  - [ ] Display performance stats, collision boundaries, and entity information.
- [ ] Create unit tests for core logic:
  - [ ] Test collision detection, pathfinding, and game mechanics.
- [ ] Establish logging for critical events and errors.

---

## 8. General Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] Refactor code for readability and maintainability:
  - [ ] Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
  - [ ] Remove redundant or commented-out code.
- [ ] Add in-line documentation and comments for complex logic.

---

### 📌 Summary

- [ ] Review and validate all improvements before integration.
- [ ] Test each improvement incrementally to avoid breaking changes.
- [ ] Document the architecture for future contributors.
